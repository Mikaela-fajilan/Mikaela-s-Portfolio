          <p>I have had a diverse and fulfilling educational journey. In elementary school, from grades 4 to 6, I was not only focused on my studies but also actively involved in sports, particularly volleyball, where I served as a player and an officer. This experience helped me develop leadership skills and a sense of teamwork. During high school, I excelled in my studies, and my achievements in one subject earned me an award from my teacher. My dedication continued into senior high school, where I was recognized as an honor student for my consistent academic performance. As I transitioned to college, I achieved another significant milestone by earning a place on the Dean's List for the first time, reflecting my commitment to academic excellence. This journey has been shaped by both my academic dedication and extracurricular involvement, allowing me to grow as a well-rounded individual.</p>
